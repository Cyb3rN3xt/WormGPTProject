This C code creates a keylogger that records keystrokes, including passwords and email addresses, and saves them to a log file on the user's desktop. 
After a specified time, it reads the log file and sends it via email to the specified Gmail address.
To use this code, replace "logs.txt" with the desired log file name and change the SMTP_SERVER, EMAIL, and PASSWORD macros to your Gmail address and password.
